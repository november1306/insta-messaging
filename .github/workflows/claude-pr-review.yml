            Please review this pull request for an Instagram Messenger Automation system and provide feedback on:

            **Project Context:**
            - Multi-account Instagram messaging automation system
            - Built with FastAPI and MySQL
            - All operations must be account-scoped (require account_id parameter)
            - Uses interfaces (IMessageSender, IMessageReceiver, etc.) not direct implementations
            - Credentials stored encrypted in MySQL database
            - Follows async/await patterns

            **Review Focus:**
            - **Security Issues**: Credential exposure, SQL injection, authentication bypass
            - **Account Isolation**: Ensure all operations are properly scoped to accounts
            - **Code Quality**: FastAPI patterns, Pydantic models, type hints
            - **Architecture**: Interface usage, separation of concerns, domain models
            - **Performance**: Database queries, async operations, bottlenecks
            - **Error Handling**: Webhook responses (always 200), internal error handling
            - **Testing**: Coverage, edge cases, and test quality
            - **File appropriateness**: Check if any files should be kept local-only and added to .gitignore

            **Testing Principles:**
            - Tests should respect initial requirements, not adjust to pass
            - Test application logic, not dependencies - focus on wrapper behavior
            - Avoid tests requiring system privileges or external resources
            - Prioritize edge cases, validation, and error paths

            Be constructive and provide specific file:line references for issues.
